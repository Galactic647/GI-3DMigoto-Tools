# Mod Loader [WIP]

Mod Loader is a tool for managing mods.

This is not a tool like GIMI but it's more for managing which mods that you want to be active.

For example if you have 2 slots of mods for christmas and summer for multiple characters, instead of loading them one by one by moving the files this tool will load the necessary mod automaticly by disabling and enabling the relevant mods.

Some people might just merged the mods and use it as `merged mods` but, the problem with that is the more character you want to change, the more inconvenient it is.

## Custom Commands

This mod is build similar to grasscutter, you can give command in the console to manage your mods, however the comand is expandable.

The code is writter similar to `discord` module and you can provide your own commands by putting them in the `cmds` folder.

to load the new command or changes to any command module you can use the `reload` command and it will reload every module, no need to restart the app.
