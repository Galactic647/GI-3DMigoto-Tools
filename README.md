# GI-3Dmigoto-Tools

I usually make standalone tools for [3DMigoto GIMI](https://github.com/SilentNightSound/GI-Model-Importer).  

Some of these tools are the one that I made myself or based on someone else's code.  

If I use someone else's code, I will credit them and link to their original code.

--------------------

I will make new tools if I think it's useful or if you do need a tool then you can join the [modding discord](https://discord.gg/agmg) and go to `#help` and tag me, or make an issue for this repo.
